# hCard Builder

This is the frontend component of an app that will allow users to input and preview their personal details in the hCard format. [hCard is a simple, open format for publishing people, companies and
organisations on the web](http://microformats.org/wiki/h-card).

## Features
* Allows user to input their personal details through a form
* As the form is filled out, the preview live-updates in the hCard format
* Minimal form validation (required fields, post code must be a number) before form can be submitted
* When the user selects an image to upload an avatar, a thumbnail is shown in the preview
* The submit button does not function (doesn't try to POST and currently alerts "Creating hCard...")
* Responsive for different screen widths
* Works in the latest version of the Chrome browser

## Technologies
* This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
* Uses [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) (CSS Preprocessor) for styling
* Unit tests using Sinon, Jest and Enzyme
* h-card format (MF2)

## Other Comments/TODO

* ~~Should refactor SCSS using global variables and mixins (currently not very DRY)~~
* Form component can be further broken down and made reusable. Currently the input fields/labels are hardcoded but could be passed in via props
* The correct props are associated with their relevant h-card properties when HTML-ified JSX is run through [this MicroFormats Validator](http://pin13.net/mf2/), however need to make sure that the compiled output generated by `<CardPreview>` also validates
* More testing needed; only basic unit testing exists in the `<CardBuilder />` and `<Form>` components
* Make more responsive at smaller screen widths
* Add proper linting (have relied on linting that comes out of the box with Create React App, which is pretty forgiving)
* Some effort made to use semantic HTML but more could be done for SEO and accessibility
* Could look into making a simple backend e.g. SQLITE and local file system
* About 9h taken including some waffling
